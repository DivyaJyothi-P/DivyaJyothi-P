### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,I'm Divya Jyothi P!
An Electrical and Electronics Engineer passionate about the Electrical Vehicle(EV) industry,with hands on experience in MATLAB,Simulinka and Embedded systems.I have completed an **Executive Post Graduate Certificate Program in Electric Vehicle Design conducted by iHUB DivyaSampark at Indian institute of Technology Roorkee in association with Department of science and Technology**
Currently, Iâ€™m working with the **Kerala State Electricity Board Ltd (KSEBL)** on a contract basis, gaining practical experience in electrical systems and grid infrastructure. Iâ€™m now seeking opportunities in the electric vehicle domain where I can apply my skills, and contribute to sustainable mobility solutions.
